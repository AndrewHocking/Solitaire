***This is a work in progress***

This is the second SwiftUI app I have made without the aid of a tutorial. Ideally it will eventually be one app to rule them all on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. One interesting thing to note about this is that I have used no image files in this app. Every graphical element has been made using SwiftUI and the SF Symbols library! Creating all the card faces took a *long* time, but it was really satisfying when it was done!

This was my initial lockdown project when school was over and my workplace closed. I do hope to finish it up in the near future!
