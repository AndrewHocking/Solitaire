Hello Shopify hiring manager! ðŸ‘‹

This app is very unfinished, but I believe it better shows my abilities than other personal projects I have done. I know you said to submit an iOS app, but this is an iOS/iPadOS/macOS Catalyst app that, at the moment, runs best on macOS, but will eventually be properly supported on all these OSes. If you would like to check out a purely iOS-only app I have made, I would recommend checking out my [Metrognome](https://github.com/AndrewHocking/Metrognome) app, but it is much more basic and bare-bones. It was the first SwiftUI app I made without the aid of a tutorial, and this Solitaire app is the second.
